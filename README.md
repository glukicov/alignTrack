# alignTrack

Welcome to this collaborative repo for UCL g-2 team!  

The file mp2tst.bin [default binary file] is produced by mptest2.f90 [lines 98, 354- 381]. 

Here are the instructions to get the code on working on DAQ1: 

0) `scl enable devtoolset-3 python27 bash`

1)  `git clone https://github.com/glukicov/alignTrack.git`
to get the latest code from our repository 

2) `cd alignTrack/mpIIDESY`

3) `make`
to build the pede executable 

4) `test that it works by pede -t`
(should give a terminal output [last 2 lines]:
 Millepede II-P ending   ... Mon Dec 12 12:31:15 2016 
 Peak dynamic memory allocation:    0.100512 GB

5) `make -f handler.mk`
This build my handler code from MilleHandler.cpp (requires C++11) 
It has root capabilities for future testing/integration 

6) `Run the above with  ./MilleHandler`
This produces test.bin and test.root

7) To check the binary file do `python readMilleBinary.py "FILENAME" "N of line"`
e.g. `python readMilleBinary.py test.bin -1` [reads our binary for all lines] 
e.g. `python readMilleBinary.py mp2tst.bin 2` [reads default binary for 2 lines] 


###### Running C++ Port of Test 1 ######
1. Compile code with `g++ -o mptest1 mptest1_port.cpp -std=c++11 -I .`, or similar with `clang` etc.
2. Generate data by running `./mptest1`. This generates:
   * `mp2tst.bin`: A binary file containing fitting data.
   * `mp2con.txt`: A plaintext file containing parameter constraints.
   * `mp2str.txt`: A plaintext file containing steering information for `pede`. (Note - it is important to use the steering file generated here, rather than that generated by `./pede -t`, as this steering file flags the data binary as being generated by C, rather than Fortran.)
3. Fit data by running `./pede mp2str.txt`. 


### To run PEDE algorithm ###
1. ./pede mp2str.txt [where e.g. mp2str.txt is a steering file, which specifies both - a data.bin file and a constraint file (e.g. mp2con.txt)]
